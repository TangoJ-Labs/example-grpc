Hey thanks for attending the Austin Go meetup "Go for gRPC and Docker Container Communication"!

Below is the repo for the examples along with a PDF of the gRPC slides.  I added some comments to the code and additional details in the readme to better explain some concepts I did not explain well during the presentation.  The Go channels used for blocking (discussed during the meeting) during bi-directional streaming have also been simplified, so that example should be easier to follow.  A big thanks to all of you with more experience who helped clarify some of the technical details!

For those interested in Hyperledger Fabric, below is the repo for a tutorial I created to walk through the basics of starting a Fabric network.  The slides you saw at the meeting are included.  The tutorial has not been updated in several months, but should be compatible with Fabric through version 1.3.
